### Hi!
I'm Paulo, software developer and IT engineer.

Althouth I love to learn new technologies, my go-to technologies for front-end development are HTML, CSS and pure vanilla JavaScript, while for back-end I'm more confortable working with Node.js. For the development of desktop applications, my favourite programming language is Python.

The majority of my time is spent researching, prototyping and writting code.
